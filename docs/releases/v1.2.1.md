# Arbiter v1.2.1

## Release intent

v1.2.1 is a patch release that hardens release operations and version-governance consistency.

## Changed

- Added automated version bump tooling to update Cargo/OpenAPI/API version/schema `$id`/README references together.
- Added strict version consistency checks across tag, Cargo, OpenAPI, schema metadata, and docs references.
- Added release-time drift guard coverage for contract schema linkage.
- Standardized release image policy on GHCR with versioned tags only.

## Compatibility

- No protocol-surface changes beyond version metadata alignment.
- Existing v1.2.0 envelope contracts remain intact; this release focuses on release-process reliability.
