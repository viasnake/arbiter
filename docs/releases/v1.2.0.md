# Arbiter v1.2.0

## Release intent

v1.2.0 is a protocol reset that turns Arbiter into a governance mediator and contract unifier.

- Arbiter is provider-agnostic.
- Arbiter does not execute side effects.
- Arbiter publishes governance and contract fingerprints via `/v1/contracts`.

## Breaking changes

- Legacy provider-shaped schemas are removed.
- API contracts now use provider-agnostic envelopes (`ops.*`).
- OpenAPI now defines only the v1.2.0 envelope protocol surface.

## Invariants

- Determinism: `decision.evaluation_time` is derived from `event.occurred_at`.
- Idempotency:
  - `POST /v1/events` keyed by `(tenant_id, event_id)`.
  - `POST /v1/action-results` keyed by `(tenant_id, plan_id, action_id)`.
- Payload mismatch conflicts return `409 conflict.payload_mismatch` with hash diagnostics.
- Audit remains append-only and hash-chained.

## Non-goals

- No connector/executor runtime implementation.
- No provider-specific branching in Arbiter.
- No executor registration in Arbiter state.

## Compatibility policy

Backward compatibility is intentionally not provided in this release.
Arbiter has no production users at the time of v1.2.0 cut.
